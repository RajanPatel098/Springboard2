Branching Exercise
Part I
Answer the following questions:

Q;What git command creates a branch?
    A: git checkout -b
Q:What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
    A:  fast forward merges are only possible if there have been no commits on the first original branch whilst other branches are being added to/changed.
Q:What git command changes to another branch?
    A:  git checkout changes to other branches
Q:What git command deletes a branch?
    A: git branch -D
Q:How do merge conflicts happen?
    A: Merge conflicts occur when git isnt able to determine what folder/file to choose when
    merging since there was multiple different commits with changes to that same folder/file


Part II
Practice with fast forward and recursive merges! Make a branch and add and commit onto it and merge it back into master.

Try to create your own merge conflict by modifying the same file on two separate commits on two separate branches.
